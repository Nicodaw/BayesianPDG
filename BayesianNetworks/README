Instructions on gathering metrics
==================================

1. Open the desired network
2. Select a single node you want to evaluate (this node will not be observed)
3. from the toolbar select Cases --> Test with Cases and load in data/combined.csv

a window will be populated with different metrics. Our main concern is the error rate of misclassified entries for that parameter and the quadratic loss

to get a full description on all parameters in the network, repeat [2,3] for each one
